# Potential Memory Leak in C Code

This repository demonstrates a potential memory leak in C and its solution.

The `bug.c` file contains a code snippet that shows a common scenario where memory management isn't properly handled, even though it might not always lead to an immediate crash or noticeable error in a small program. The principle, however, can lead to leaks in larger projects. In contrast, `bugSolution.c` provides an approach to mitigate this potential issue.

## Bug Description

The primary problem lies in the lack of explicit memory deallocation. While the example in `bug.c` doesn't immediately trigger a memory leak in this context, similar scenarios where memory is dynamically allocated (using `malloc`, `calloc`, etc.) but not freed (using `free`) can lead to memory leaks.   Improper memory management is common in C programs and is often a cause of program instability and crashes. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.c` shows no changes in this specific example, as there's no dynamic memory allocation.  However, the principle of the solution would involve carefully using `free` to deallocate memory which was dynamically allocated.
